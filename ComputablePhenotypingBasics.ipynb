    "## What Is a Computable Phenotype?\n",
    "\n",
    "- A **computable phenotype** is a *reproducible, algorithmic definition* of a clinical condition or trait that can be implemented on electronic health data.\n",
    "- It consists of **structured criteria**, such as:\n",
    "  - Diagnosis codes (e.g., ICD-10, SNOMED)\n",
    "  - Lab values (e.g., HbA1c > 6.5%)\n",
    "  - Medications\n",
    "  - Procedures\n",
    "  - Clinical observations\n",
    "- Used to identify **patients or events** corresponding to a clinical phenomenon of interest (e.g., “type 2 diabetes”, “ICU delirium”, “post-operative infection”).\n",
    "- In practice, it is typically represented as a **cohort definition**: inclusion/exclusion logic applied over time, not just a static list of codes.\n",
    "\n",
    "> As emphasized in the *Book of OHDSI*:  \n",
    "> *“A cohort is not defined by [just a] code set. A well-defined cohort specifies how a patient enters a cohort and how a patient exits a cohort.”*  \n",
    "> This means that timing, frequency, and context matter.\n",

    "##  Why Do We Need Computable Phenotypes?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Real-world data is messy** - clinical concepts are not neatly labeled.\n",
    "- We must **infer clinical states** from data collected for routine care or billing.\n",
    "- Computable phenotypes provide a **standard bridge** between:\n",
    "  - **Clinical understanding** (what coma means medically)\n",
    "  - **Data logic** (how to find it in structured EHR fields)\n",
    "- They enable:\n",
    "  - **Reproducible research**: same definition = same cohort across studies.\n",
    "  - **AI/ML development**: accurate outcome labeling is essential for model training.\n",
    "  - **Portability**: definitions can be shared and reused across datasets and institutions.\n",
    "  - **Efficiency**: avoids reinventing definitions for common conditions (e.g., sepsis, diabetes).\n",
    "\n",
    " *Example:* If we want to train a model to predict coma recovery, we first need a consistent way to define “coma” and “recovery” in the data.\n",

    "## Types of Phenotype Definitions\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Rule-Based Phenotypes**\n",
    "- Built using **explicit logical rules**, typically by domain experts.\n",
    "- Example:\n",
    "  - *“≥2 outpatient diagnoses of type 2 diabetes (ICD-10 E11.x) AND HbA1c > 6.5%.”*\n",
    "- Transparent, interpretable, and easy to implement with SQL, ATLAS, or cohort tools.\n",
    "- Often used in clinical studies and shared libraries (e.g., OHDSI Phenotype Library).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Probabilistic / ML-Based Phenotypes**\n",
    "- Use **machine learning models** to classify patients.\n",
    "- Trained on labeled datasets or proxy gold standards.\n",
    "- Example:\n",
    "  - Logistic regression or neural network identifies “drug-induced liver injury” based on patterns.\n",
    "- Can capture **complex or subtle patterns** that rules might miss.\n",
    "- Require:\n",
    "  - Ground truth labels (e.g., from chart review or registries)\n",
    "  - Careful validation to avoid overfitting or spurious features\n",
    "\n",
    "*Note:* Many modern phenotyping approaches use **hybrids**: rules + NLP + ML.\n",

    "#  Background: OMOP CDM and Phenotyping\n",
    "\n",
    "Developing **sharable, reproducible phenotypes** is greatly enhanced by using a **Common Data Model (CDM)**. One of the most widely adopted CDMs in healthcare research is the **OMOP CDM**, maintained by the OHDSI community.\n",
    "\n",
    "The OMOP CDM organizes clinical data into **standardized, domain-specific tables** (e.g., `person`, `condition_occurrence`, `drug_exposure`, `measurement`, etc.) and encodes all clinical concepts using **standard vocabularies** like:\n",
    "- **SNOMED CT** (diagnoses and conditions)\n",
    "- **LOINC** (laboratory tests)\n",
    "- **RxNorm** (medications)\n",
    "- **ICD-9/10** (mapped to SNOMED)\n",
    "\n",
    "This structure allows researchers to write **a single, portable phenotype definition** that works across any OMOP-transformed dataset. The same definition can be applied in different hospitals, health systems, or research networks - enabling **portability, consistency, and reuse**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Communities like **OHDSI** and **FDA Sentinel** leverage this model to create **libraries of reusable computable phenotypes** for conditions such as diabetes, sepsis, and COVID-19.\n",

    "-  **Domain-Based Tables**  \n",
    "    - Each type of data (conditions, procedures, drugs, measurements) is stored in its own table.\n",
    "    - Tables contain rows of clinical events linked to a `person_id`, with standardized `concept_id`s.\n",
    "\n",
    "-  **Standardized Vocabularies**  \n",
    "    - Every clinical term is mapped to a **standard concept**.\n",
    "    - This enables **cross-system interoperability** (e.g., a single diabetes concept can include ICD-9, ICD-10, SNOMED codes).\n",
    "\n",
    "-  **Temporal Data**  \n",
    "    - Most tables include **event dates** and optionally **timestamps**.\n",
    "    - Supports **temporal logic** in phenotyping (e.g., “diagnosis must occur during hospital stay”).\n",
    "\n",
    "-  **Reproducibility & Portability**  \n",
    "    - OMOP cohort definitions can be stored as **JSON or SQL**.\n",

    "## Why OMOP Matters in Rule-Based and Probabilistic Phenotyping\n",
    "\n",
    "- Enables **cross-platform** and **multi-institutional research** by harmonizing EHR data into a common schema.\n",
    "- Reduces **ambiguity** in clinical condition definitions by enforcing structured vocabularies and reproducible logic.\n",
    "- Simplifies **validation** and **reuse** of phenotypes through sharable cohort definitions and community-reviewed libraries.\n",
    "- Provides a **standard foundation for both rule-based and machine learning (ML)-based phenotyping workflows**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What About Machine Learning?\n",
    "\n",
    "OMOP is not limited to rule-based phenotyping - it also plays a key role in **ML and probabilistic phenotyping** by:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Structuring the input space: Features like demographics, diagnoses, medications, labs, and procedures are organized and standardized, making them easy to use as inputs to ML models.\n",
    "- Enabling **label generation**: Rule-based phenotypes created with tools like **ATLAS** can be used to define cohorts for training supervised models (e.g., “cases” and “controls”).\n",
    "- Supporting scalable feature extraction: Using OMOP CDM, features can be derived consistently across datasets without bespoke pipelines.\n",
    "- Ensuring portability: ML models trained on OMOP data are more portable because input fields are consistent across sites.\n",
    "\n",
    "###  Do I Need ATLAS for ML?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Not directly.** ATLAS is not a machine learning tool, but:\n",
    "  - It helps you define **high-quality cohorts and labels** using clinical logic.\n",
    "  - These definitions can be exported and used to **train or evaluate ML models**.\n",
    "  - In semi-supervised pipelines (e.g., using **Aphrodite**), ATLAS-defined cohorts often serve as “anchors” or weak labels.\n",

    "### Interpreting the Result\n",
    "- **Person 1** and **Person 2** met the cohort criteria (coma on admission due to brain injury).\n",
    "- Person 1 recovered: GCS increased to 9 by day 3.\n",
    "- Person 2 did not recover: GCS stayed ≤ 5 and the patient died.\n",
    "- **Person 3** was not included in the cohort: no acute brain injury diagnosis and normal GCS.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This example demonstrates how we apply inclusion criteria and outcome assessment in code.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Real-World Implementation Notes\n",
    "In a real OMOP database, implementation might use SQL joins across `condition_occurrence`, `visit_occurrence`, and `measurement` tables with temporal constraints (e.g., ensuring the measurement is within 24h of ICU admission).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Phenotyping Logic Summary:**\n",
    "- Define cohort entry: ICU admission with brain injury and coma (GCS ≤ 8).\n",
    "- Additional filters: Adult patients, first ICU stay only.\n",
    "- Outcome: GCS improvement within 72 hours.\n",
    "- Label for modeling: Binary yes/no for early recovery.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Validation Strategy\n",
    "- Internal validation: Review sample cases (e.g., 20 \"recovered\" and 20 \"non-recovered\") to assess positive predictive value (PPV) and sensitivity.\n",
    "- Evaluate edge cases: e.g., comatose patients without explicit brain injury diagnosis might be missed.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Phenotype Reusability\n",
    "This definition uses standard OMOP concepts (e.g., SNOMED for brain injury, LOINC for GCS). The cohort logic can be exported as JSON or SQL and reused across OMOP datasets (e.g., MIMIC-IV OMOP). This ensures consistent, replicable identification of coma recovery cohorts across institutions."

    "## Other Example Challenges and Phenotypes\n",
    "\n",
    "Briefly, let's touch on how one might approach other complex phenotyping challenges mentioned:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Healthcare-Associated Infection (HAI) in ICU\n",
    "- **Phenotyping Goal**: Distinguish hospital-acquired infections from those present on admission.\n",
    "- **Computable Definition**:\n",
    "  - No infection evidence on admission (e.g., no antibiotics or positive cultures in first 48 hours).\n",
    "  - New positive culture or antibiotic course initiated after 48 hours.\n",
    "- **Advanced Features**:\n",
    "  - Include lab trends (e.g., leukocytosis), vital signs (fever), or waveform data (e.g., temperature, HRV).\n",
    "  - Validate against standard surveillance definitions (e.g., CDC for ICU infections).\n",
    "- **Student Exercise**: Propose a simple computable phenotype for HAI using structured data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Neonatal Phenotyping\n",
    "- **Context**: Newborns (e.g., in NICU) require age-specific thresholds.\n",
    "- **Example Phenotype**: Neonatal sepsis based on lab values, apnea events, bradycardia.\n",
    "- **Challenges**:\n",
    "  - Gestational age-based variation in normal ranges.\n",
    "  - High false positive rate - need multiple signals for specificity.\n",
    "- **Student Exercise**: Define phenotype criteria stratified by gestational or postnatal age.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Multimodal Coma Recovery Prediction\n",
    "- **Phenotype Use**: Serves as label for predictive models.\n",
    "- **Features**:\n",
    "  - Static: Diagnosis, demographics.\n",
    "  - Dynamic: GCS trends, vital signs, medication use.\n",
    "- **Key Point**: Accurate outcome phenotype definition ensures reliable ML training labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Physiologic “Cardio-metabolic Age”\n",
    "- **Not a binary phenotype**, but a continuous derived metric.\n",
    "- **Approach**:\n",
    "  - Use self-supervised learning on longitudinal EHR + ICU waveform data.\n",
    "  - Train to predict chronological age, then recalibrate to reflect physiologic risk.\n",
    "- **Validation**: Check correlation with outcomes (e.g., mortality, frailty).\n",
    "- **OMOP Consideration**: Use OMOP for structured data, supplement with waveform data from external sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Early Detection and Subphenotyping of AKI\n",
    "- **Standard AKI Phenotype**: Based on **Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO)** (creatinine rise ≥0.3 mg/dL in 48h or x2 baseline in 7d).\n",
    "- **Advanced Use Cases**:\n",
    "  - Early detection using lab/vital sign patterns or NLP.\n",
    "  - Subphenotyping via unsupervised clustering (e.g., shock-related vs toxic AKI).\n",
    "- **Student Exercise**:\n",
    "  - Implement AKI phenotype on synthetic data.\n",
    "  - Propose surrogate criteria for earlier detection.\n",
    "  - Discuss validation strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "Across these examples, successful phenotyping always involves:\n",
    "- Clear clinical definition and use-case framing.\n",
    "- Rule or ML-based operationalization.\n",
    "- Standardized data usage (e.g., OMOP concepts).\n",
    "- Internal and external validation.\n",

    "## Validating Phenotype Definitions\n",
    "\n",
    "Validation is critical to ensure that a computable phenotype truly reflects the intended clinical concept and behaves reliably in data. Below is a summary of best practices:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Face Validity / Expert Review**: Engage clinicians early. Ensure your criteria make sense clinically and capture the intended patients. This step can prevent logical errors that arise from a purely data-driven perspective.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Internal Consistency Checks**: Use diagnostics like OHDSI's CohortDiagnostics to assess concept distributions, incidence rates, and cohort overlaps. Discrepancies (e.g., unintended diagnoses dominating a cohort) often signal logic flaws.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Ground Truth Comparison**: Where possible, compare algorithm outputs to a gold standard (manual chart review, registry labels). This allows estimation of sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV. Consider splitting validation into:\n",
    "  - *Low-level*: Are you pulling the right data fields and concepts?\n",
    "  - *High-level*: Does the result match the true clinical state?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Multiple Sites / Datasets**: Validate on external datasets to ensure generalizability. Differences in coding habits can cause a well-performing phenotype in one setting to fail elsewhere. OMOP CDM helps portability, but validation is still necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Documenting Validation Results**: Transparently report the methods and results of validation, including metrics and limitations. This enables others to interpret results correctly and adapt definitions to their context.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Continuous Improvement**: Phenotypes evolve. Maintain version control, revalidate after changes, and document updates. Share via open libraries like OHDSI’s Phenotype Library.\n",
    "\n",
    "Robust phenotyping is interdisciplinary, iterative, and foundational for reliable downstream analytics and ML models.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Homework Assignment\n",
    "\n",
    "- Build a basic cohort definition in ATLAS.\n",
    "- Try coding a simple phenotype using synthetic data.\n",
    "- Explore published definitions in the OHDSI Phenotype Library.\n",
    "> Remember: your phenotype is the foundation for robust inference or ML model development.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Optional Task\n",
    "Choose one of the following and develop a computable phenotype:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Early Hospital-Acquired Infection (HAI) Detection\n",
    "- **Goal**: Identify patients who developed infections during hospitalization.\n",
    "- **Criteria**: No infection signs on admission; positive culture or antibiotics started after 48h.\n",
    "- **Validation**: Compare with infection control logs or chart review.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. NICU Alarm Fatigue: Significant Apnea/Bradycardia Events\n",
    "- **Goal**: Identify clinically significant events while excluding false alarms.\n",
    "- **Criteria**: Event durations, oxygen desaturation thresholds, stratify by gestational age.\n",
    "- **Validation**: Compare with nurse annotations or alarm logs.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. AKI Onset and Subphenotyping\n",
    "- **Goal**: Identify and cluster types of AKI.\n",
    "- **Criteria**: KDIGO thresholds on creatinine; subclassify using vitals, diagnoses.\n",
    "- **Validation**: Confirm AKI by manual chart review or match known outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Deliverables:**\n",
    "1. **Phenotype Definition** – Include logic, thresholds, and rationale.\n",
    "2. **Code or Pseudocode** – SQL/Python/R or structured pseudocode.\n",
    "3. **Validation Plan** – Describe how you'll test accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Quiz Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "1.\tIn your own words, what is a computable phenotype and how does it differ from a traditional narrative phenotype description?\n",
    "2.\tWhy is using a common data model like OMOP and standard vocabularies important in sharing phenotype definitions across institutions?\n",
    "3.\tName two tools or resources that can assist in creating computable phenotypes and briefly describe their roles (e.g., what does OHDSI ATLAS provide? What is contained in the OHDSI Phenotype Library?).\n",
    "4.\tSuppose you want to define a phenotype for “Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)” using EHR data. What data elements might you include in the criteria (give at least three), and what are some challenges in making this definition computable?\n",
    "5.\tDescribe the difference between low-level (technical) validation and high-level (clinical) validation of a phenotype algorithm. Why are both necessary?\n",
    "6.\tIf a phenotype algorithm has a sensitivity of 95% and a positive predictive value (PPV) of 60%, what does that mean in practical terms? In what scenarios might such an algorithm be acceptable, and when might it be problematic?\n",
    "7.\tProvide an example of a temporal criterion in a phenotype definition (for any condition) and explain how you would implement it in a database query or code.\n",
    "8.\tHow can unstructured data (like clinical notes) or high-frequency data (like ICU waveforms) enhance phenotyping? What additional steps or tools are needed to incorporate these into a computable phenotype?"
